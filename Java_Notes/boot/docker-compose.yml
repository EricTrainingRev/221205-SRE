# A Docker Compose must always start with the version tag.
version: '3'

# Docker Compose works with services.
# 1 service = 1 container.
# For example, a server, a client, a database...
# We use the keyword 'services' to start to create services.
services:

  # the name of this serivce(container) is called "app".
  app:
    # the image tells docker what image we are building
    image: sports
    # the build section provides docker with the details needed to build the specified image
    build:
      # context tells docker where to copy any necessary files from: . indicates current directory
      context: .
      dockerfile: dockerfile
    # container_name sets the name of the container. simulates adding the --name flag to docker run
    container_name: app
    # ports maps the host port (left side) to the container port (right side)
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

    # depends_on is useful if you need another container to be created first
    # depends_on:
    #   - dependency
    # you can set environment variables in the container
