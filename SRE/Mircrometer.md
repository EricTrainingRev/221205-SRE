# Micrometer
Micrometer is similar to SLF4J: by itself it doesn't do anything. When used with a tool like Spring Boot, however, Micrometer provides the means for exposing relevant application metrics that we can then measure using a tool of our choice.
- Micrometer works as a "simple facade"
- Micrometer allows us to expose common metrics provided by Spring that we will use to measure our SLIs
