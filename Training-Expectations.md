# Zoom Etiquette
- Turn your camera on before you start talking
    - if your camera is off when you talk you will be asked to turn it on before receiving an answer
- Communicate any technical issues with your mic or camera before training starts if possible
- Be conscious of your environment:
    - make sure you are muted if you are not talking
    - make sure you are in an environment suitable for training
        - quiet
        - few distractions
        - good lighting
- don't smoke, vape, or drink alcoholic beverages on camera
- be mindful of what you are eating or drinking on camera
- use the raise hand Zoom feature if you have questions
    - keep your questions on topic
# Behavior Expectations
- Be respectful to everyone
- If you disagree with someone else do so without personally attacking the other person
- Do not plagiarize other peoples' work
- Swearing/cussing is not considered work appropriate behavior: please refrain from doing so while in a training setting

# Training Mediums

- Lectures
- Projects
- Quizzes
- Mock Interviews
- Coding Challenges
- Practice Examples

# Required Software/Tools
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)
    - I highly recommend you check the "Open with Visual Studio Code" options when you download VSC: while not necessary, they will provide a very nice quality-of-life feature for right clicking on a directory or file and opening it in VSC directly
- [Github Account](https://github.com/)
    - after you create a Github account you will need to install a local version of [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
        - we will be using GitBash, so much sure the "Git Bash here" box is checked under Windows Explorer Integration on the Select Components page
        - on the "Adjusting the name of the initial branch in new repositories" page I recommend you choose the lower option to override the default naming convention and choose the default name of "main". Again, this is not necessary, but it will make things more consistent between your local Git software and your Github default settings
        - if you have experience with Node, Python, or other programming languages that make constant use of the terminal, I recommend checking the "Enable Experimental Support for psuedo consoles" option on the experimental options page
