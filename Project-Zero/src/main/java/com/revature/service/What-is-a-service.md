# Service Layer
The Service layer is meant to handle "Business Rules". These are constraints/requirements from a third party (typically the individual/s you are building the application for or the company you work for) that are not program specific. For instance, you may have a business rule that users of your application can not share the same username. There is nothing specific in Java that prevents this from happening, so you as the creator of the code would have to work this rule into your application. You would do this in the "Service layer".
