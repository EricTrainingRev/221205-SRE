# Instructions
- Share your github link to your project work
- Your presentation should be no longer than 5 minutes
    - we will cut you off if you go over
- You should show off your http routes working as intended (repository & service layer are implemented)
    - create a collection in Thunder Client or Postman 
        - make sure to order your routes in such a way that they can work (because users need to be logged in for many of the routes to work)
        - make sure your database has the correct data in it for your routes to work
            - you can make a script to set up the database with the proper information before your presentation
- You need to show that your application is logging relevant data to your log file (logging implemented)
- You need to show off your bash script that calculates your SLIs from your log files (shows you can measure SLIs)
    - your script should be working with your log files directly, they should not be reading from some pre-made file with dummy data
    - Anyone who has been able to complete the stretch goal can show it off at this time as well
- You will end the presentation fielding questions
