# Title

# Break
Short description of how you broke the planetarium

# Visual
Display of the broken code: use three back tics before and after the code snippet to format your code
```java
public class BrokenCode{
    // code with comments for what is broken
}
```

display of what the code should actually be for the planetarium  app to be fixed
```java
public class FixedCode{
    // code with comments for how it was fixed
}
```
**Note: the broken "code" could be configurations, xml, etc. Just make sure you show what is broken and how it can be fixed**

# Indicator
brief explanation of what metrics will indicate the application is broken, preferably with screenshots of what the metrics/graphs indicating the problem look like in grafana.

**Note: make sure your broken app actually returns the expected metrics by deploying it either locally or in your team's cluster**
