## General Instructions
- Cameras should stay on for the entire presentation, even when it is not your team's time to present
- Mics should be muted unless it is your team's time to present
- A code freeze (no new work) should be implemented the day before the showcase

## Order of Operation
1. Introduction
    - Introduce yourselves
        - Scrum Master should start the presentation
    - Give an overview of your cluster work you will be discussing
        - What Epics did you work on?
2. P3 Cluster Work
- for each epic:
    - Explain how you broke down the epic into individual user stories
    - Explain your thought process for each user story
        - how does it fit with the epic?
        - on what basis did you assign story points?
    - Explain how you delegated work for each user story
    - Showcase the completed work for each user story
        - show the actual work in your cluster, don't just add pictures to your PowerPoint
            - for instance, if you set up a devops pipeline show it in action
                - make sure it actually works before showing it off
3. P3 Incident Management
- choose the most interesting Incident your team dealt with for this part of the presentation
- Talk through the incident management process your team went through for the incident
    - what roles did each team member have?
    - what triggered the incident?
        - what alert/s indicated the issue?
    - what mitigating efforts did you take?
        - did you need to rollback the deployment, or did you have a deployment strategy in place for switching back to an old deployment?
    - what was the problem?
        - What indicated the problem to you?
        - How did you know where to look to solve the issue?
    - what conditions made you confident the incident had been handled?
4. Conclusion (Project Retrospective)
- What were your accomplishments as a team?
    - what went well?
    - what were you proud of?
- What would your team have focused on if the project were to continue?
    - adjustments to deployment?
    - new monitoring features?
    - epics to finish?
    - epics you would start on?
    - NOTE: THIS IS NOT A TIME TO TALK ABOUT WHAT DIDN'T WORK WELL, THIS IS A TIME TO SAY WHAT NEXT STEPS WOULD BE IF YOU HAD MORE TIME FOR THIS PROJECT

## PowerPoint Expectation
- Your team PowerPoint should be an aid to your presentation, not the presentation itself
    - don't read off the PowerPoint
- Your team PowerPoint should have a mix of visuals and text
    - add Grafana charts
        - logs
        - metrics
    - add Alert notifications
        - Grafana alerts
        - email alerts
        - etc
    - add graphs to represent statistics not provided by your monitoring tools
        - remaining Error Budget after an incident
        - stats on what methods caused the most issues
        - etc

## Background Expectations
- Your backgrounds are meant to help identify what team you are on
- Backgrounds should not be distracting
    - no moving images
    - keep them simple

## Presentation Attire expectations
- Normal Monday business professional attire is fine

## Documentation Expectations
- Have your documentation prepped for display: you don't know if someone will ask a question about it
- you can add documentation sections to your PowerPoint to create visuals if you want, just don't put an entire doc into a slide 

## Presentation Practice
- Every team will be expected to give a minimum of two practice presentations to the trainer
- Every team is highly encouraged to give one or more practice presentations to the other teams
- Every team is highly encouraged to write down their speeches as part of their presentation prep

## General Suggestions
- Have one person who controls the PowerPoint at all times
- Have one person (same person who controls the PowerPoint) be the only person who shares their screen for the presentation
- Have dedicated speaking roles for each person
- Each team member should have an area of the project they are prepared to discuss during the Q&A session
- don't underestimate the power of writing down your speaking parts for the presentation: it will help reduce the use of filler words, give you confidence in what you are saying, and help you from getting off track of the topic you are meant to be discussing.
    - use [this](https://thereadtime.com/) tool to gauge how long your speaking parts will take in order to make sure you and your team are as close to the 12 minute mark as possible
        - 3 person teams will want each team member to say a little under 1000 words, 4 person teams will want to say just under 750 words each
    - you are free to use your written speech during the showcase, just make sure you don't share it on screen
        - use a second screen, tablet, or some other resource to read your speech from if necessary
