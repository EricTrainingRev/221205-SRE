# AWS

## What is AWS
Amazon Web Services is Amazon's cloud service provider. Any time you hear someone talking about "the cloud" in the software field they are talking about hardware/software that someone else provides over the internet. AWS has become one of the premier cloud providers in modern times alongside Microsoft Azure and Google's Google Cloud Platform.

## AWS RDS
One of the services AWS provides is their Relational Database Services (RDS). Using this service we can create relational databases and persist our information in them. We will be using AWS RDS in your P0 and beyond to persist information. For training we will be using a Postgres database provided by AWS RDS.
